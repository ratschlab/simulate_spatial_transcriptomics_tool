### Summary

> We adapted the simulation approach suggested in [5] by introducing spatial structure in the experiment. Briefly, relying on simulated ground truth labels, we simulate transcriptomics and morphology modalities, allowing partial observation of true clusters within each modality individually. However, combining both modalities enables the identification of all clusters. Spatial coordinates are incorporated by sorting the ground truth in spatial space.
